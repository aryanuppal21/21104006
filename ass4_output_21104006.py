Enter first integer value(dividend): 567
Enter second integer value(divisor): 45

Quotient: 12 
Remainder: 27

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 12, 27]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {27, 12, 5, 6}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({27, 12, 5, 6})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 27
The hash value of 27(considering it to be integer) is 27 and its hash value is -3162869481920262287(if we consider 27 as a string).
